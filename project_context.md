# Habit.sys OS: System Context & Baseline

Habit.sys OS is a mechanical, 1-bit habit tracking interface designed for **systematic self-optimization**. It treats habits as core system modules that must be stabilized before further expansion.

## 💾 System State

### Architecture & Tech Stack
- **Engine**: [Next.js 15](https://nextjs.org/) (Server-Side Execution)
- **Data Terminal**: [Supabase](https://supabase.com/) (Distributed Postgres)
- **Visual Interface**: [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/) with **Atkinson Protocol** (1-bit Design System)
- **Display Mode**: High-contrast Black & White, hardware-acceleration dithering.
- **Font Face**: [VT323](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/VT323) (System Bitmap)

### Core Directives
- **Single Node Focus**: The system prioritizes the most recent protocol initialization to prevent cognitive overload.
- **Identity-First Boot**: Habit initialization begins by defining the target system state (Identity) before the execution parameters (Habit).
- **Retro-System Windows**: Data is encapsulated in rigid, solid-bordered window modules.
- **Check-In Matrix**: A high-contrast task list where protocols are executed and prioritized based on load-state.

### Database Terminal
- `habits`: Stores the identity directives and protocol parameters.
- `habit_logs`: Tracks execution logs (completions).

## 🛰️ System Roadmap

### 1. Stability & Protocol Integration
- **Stability Metrics**: Visual indicators of protocol integration that mature as uptime increases.
- **Integration Milestones**: System-wide visual feedback for 7, 30, and 100-day uptime targets.

### 2. Systematic Enhancements
- **"System Pulsing"**: Timed alerts for protocol execution (Cue triggers).
- **"Recovery Mode"**: Low-power execution mode for emergency protocol maintenance.
- **"Mechanical Feedback"**: Hardware-inspired soundscapes and visual glitches upon protocol stabilization.

### 3. Archive & System History
- **The Archives**: Secure storage for fully integrated protocols.
- **System Evolution**: A visual timeline of identity states adopted by the operator.

## 🎨 Atkinson Protocol (Visual Standards)
- **Containerization**: Solid-bordered modules with 3px black lines.
- **System Shadow**: `box-shadow: 4px 4px 0px 0px #000;`
- **Dithering Modes**: Hardware-level patterns (50% check, 25% stipple) for depth without grayscale.

## 🧪 System Verification

### 1. Logic Validation
- **Vitest**: Unit testing for server actions and protocol stability calculations.

### 2. Physical Rendering
- **Browser Subagent**: Verify 1-bit adherence and terminal-grade layout precision.

### 3. End-to-End (E2E) Execution
- **Playwright**: Automate the standard operator path:
  1. System Auth.
  2. Protocol Initialization.
  3. Execution Log Entry.
  4. Stability Upshift Verification.
